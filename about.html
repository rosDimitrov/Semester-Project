        <h1 class="">What is Squares?</h1> <p>Squares is a digital solution, where designers and customers work together building individual designs. Designers can publish their sets of designs that contain pieces of graphic-elements on the website. The users can interact with any published set and rearrange the pieces in a square-grid system to create their own work of art. Hereby the users got the possibility to customize designers work into their own work of art and in the end buy it from the concerned designer.</p>
        
        <h1 class="">The Purpose</h1> <p>Through our digital solution, we want designers and customers working together building that individuality. We want a creative environment that contains people online creating through rearranging, inspiring and sharing art within the square.</p>
        
        <h1 class="">Us and the Competition</h1> <p>The market of online shops with art is very tough because there are many providers. The low startup cost in making a online store with free open-source ecommerce solutions, like Woocommerce that requires a small part of know-how and low production cost in producing posters and printing pictures attracts many people to try it out. But the core purpose of Squares is that the users can rearrange the designs and make their own art, which makes it unique on the market. Because of this canvas-feature Squares differentiates from the “regular” online art store..</p>
